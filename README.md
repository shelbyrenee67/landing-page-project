Welcome to My Landing Page Project. In this assignment, I am tasked with applying what I have learned about HTML and CSS into a complete landing page. I will be utilizing the skills I have learned in the Flexbox section of the Odin Project learning to complete this landing page. I hope to combine all of these skills, along with my ability to research a solution when I dont know it, so that I can get a sense of what it's like developing websites professionally. I hope you like it !
